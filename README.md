# Navigation Bar UI Design

## Overview

This project implements a responsive navigation bar for a design studio called **Neomind**. The navigation bar is built using **React Hooks** and **React Router**, and it features a mobile-friendly design with a functional hamburger menu. The application allows seamless navigation between pages, ensuring a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Navigation**  
  The navbar updates the page dynamically upon clicking any menu item, utilizing `React Router` for navigation.  

- **Responsive Design**  
  The navigation bar is fully mobile responsive. On smaller screens, it collapses into a **hamburger menu** that toggles the visibility of the menu items.

- **Modern Styling**  
  The design incorporates custom CSS and **Google Fonts** for a professional look, suitable for a design studio.

## Technologies Used

- **React Framework**: To build a modular and reusable navbar component.
- **React Router DOM**: For seamless client-side navigation.
- **React Hooks**: To manage state and handle component logic.
- **CSS**: For custom styling and responsiveness.
- **Google Fonts**: To enhance typography and aesthetics.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Setting up the React Framework
- Created a React application as the base for the project.

### 2. Importing `React Router DOM`
- Integrated React Router for enabling dynamic navigation between pages.

### 3. Creating the Navbar Component
- Built a reusable `Navbar` component to house the navigation functionality.

### 4. Importing Google Fonts
- Integrated a modern and professional font using Google Fonts to enhance the UI.

### 5. Styling with CSS
- Designed and implemented the layout for:
  - The main navigation bar.
  - Mobile-responsive hamburger menu.
  - Hover effects and active state indicators.

### 6. Adding Navigation Items
- Used an array of navigation items for flexibility and ease of updates.

### 7. Building a Button for Hamburger Menu
- Created a toggle button to show/hide the navigation menu in mobile view.
- Added specific CSS for the hamburger button and its states.

### 8. Implementing JSX and State Logic
- Mapped through the navigation items array to dynamically render menu links.
- Managed menu visibility using `useState` from React Hooks.
